Overwiew:- 
This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python in Google Colab. It focuses on presenting various types of data through visual tools like bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts. By leveraging popular libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy, the project offers meaningful insights into data trends and patterns.

 Introduction-
Data visualization is an essential aspect of understanding and interpreting data. In this project, I utilized Python to analyze datasets and represent them visually. The aim was to transform raw data into understandable and insightful visual representations. By using Google Colab, I was able to harness the power of Pythonâ€™s data libraries to create interactive and clear visualizations that assist in decision-making and data exploration.

Features-
Data Analysis: Extensive data manipulation and cleaning using Pandas to prepare datasets for visualization.
Visual Representation: Different chart types (bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts) for easy understanding of complex data.
Matplotlib: Utilized for plotting and customizing visuals, making them more engaging and insightful.
NumPy: Used for handling large datasets and performing complex numerical computations.
Interactive Environment: The project was built and executed in Google Colab, allowing easy sharing and collaboration.

Types of Visualizations:-
Bar Charts: Used to compare categorical data, ideal for visualizing grouped data such as sales, quantities, or frequencies.
Scatter Plots: Employed to identify relationships or correlations between two numerical variables, highlighting trends and outliers.
Line Charts: Used to track changes over time, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns in sequential datasets.

Technology Used:- Google Colab
